                        <p>eet Tom Mirman, Vice President of West Coast Tires in Los Angeles, CA. If he looks young, that's because he's only 24 years of age. Don't let that fool you, Tom knows his way around a vehicle better than most twice his age. He knows his way around the business of auto repair as well. Tom has been working at West Coast Tires since he was just a boy. His love of building hot rods, riding motorcycles and fixing what's broken have made his passion his life work.  Bob Mirman, Tom's grandfather, opened West Coast Tires over 43 years ago in West Los Angeles. What started as a simple tire shop quickly grew into something much more. They are the largest family owned tire shop, and the largest private supplier of Michelin tires in California. Their motto, "Nobody Beats Bob!", has become well known amongst those in the industry, as West Coast Tires was making it their mission to provide the best service at a truly unbeatable price. West Coast Tires is truly your one stop shop for anything automotive. From new tires to collision repair, electronic issues to a full motor swap, Tom and the guys at West Coast are among southern California's best.  </p>

Another thing Tom knows is that trying to manage your social media and online reputation can be a very time consuming task. Adding more hours to an already full work week.   With so many tire shops, auto body and collision centers in the area one way to stand out from the pack is take control of your reputation online. For help with this, Tom partnered with Quality Media and our team of social media experts. We began managing their Yelp account, and providing SEO services to help the business populate more online. Tom soon saw that reaching out to his customers to engage them and not only thank them for their support, but to also address any concerns that they may have, was an amazing way to gain lifetime clientele.  Looking to toward the future, West Coast Tires and Quality Media are working closely to take advantage of the growing popularity of social media amongst consumers. Building a following on Facebook, and keeping people up to date with any breaking news around the shop on Twitter! </p>
